    <center><h2>AJNA</h2></center>
    <center><p>
    Agya (Sanskrit: आज्ञा, IAST: Agya, English: "command"), or Third-eye Chakra, is the sixth primary Chakra or energy point in the body,
    according to Hindu tradition. It is a part of the brain which can be made more powerful through repetition, like a muscle, and signifies the conscience.

    <center><h3>Application</h3></center>  
    <p>
    So far (Aug 2016), the platform Ajna is just a functional prototype to help in the process of Exploratory Data Analysis.
    Therefore, new functionalities and application are comming soon. If you would like to see a functionality implemented, please
    feel free to fork the project or open a comment into the github project.

    <center><h3>Assumption</h3></center>  
    <p>
    1. We assume the file is in .csv format;<br>
    
    2. We assume that the first row in the file is the header;<br>
    
    3. We assume the data is already cleaned and converted to numerical, although categorical will be identified though. The descriptive statistics is 
    fully functional for numerical data and perhaps the graphs will not work properly with categorical, text, unstructured data and so on.
    </p>
